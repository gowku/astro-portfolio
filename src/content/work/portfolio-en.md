### Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

I have set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment of my application. Whenever I push changes to the Main branch of my GitHub repository, GitHub Actions creates a Docker image from those changes. Then, the Docker image is deployed to my AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. Finally, my EC2 instance in AWS is automatically updated with the latest version of my application.

This continuous integration allows me to benefit from effortless deployment and easily maintain my application up to date.

### Conclusion

Creating this portfolio has allowed me to present my skills and projects effectively while providing an intuitive and enjoyable user experience. I am excited to share my work and establish connections with potential clients, collaborators, and employers.

Feel free to explore to browse the GitHub repository for a deeper understanding of the project and its implementation.
